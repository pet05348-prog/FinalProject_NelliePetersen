        <h1>Welcome to the Let's Play page!</h1>
        <p id="text-to-change">You can change the background using the selector above. This is also the text that you can change the color of. Keep 
            in mind that depending on the image you set the background to, you may really need to change the text color... Just to 
            mention it, the strange image labeled as Night Sky 1 was created using the same prompt as the other three Night Sky images. The AI image 
            generators can really come up with some weird stuff sometimes. I really kind of wanted to do the other webpages with generated images as the background, 
            but since the other pages were so messy with all the other stuff on it, letting you guys pick an image seemed like an 'ok' idea. This website 
            was made for a class I am currently taking and how often I will update is unknown, but I do occassionally get the image generating bug, so I 
            will probably update it a bit. This website was a real eye-opener for me. I thought that I was doing fairly well once I got all the images 
            loaded onto the pages, but then I started doing the JavaScipt. What was really fun was the fact that I kept getting errors on pages because 
            the JavaScript kept trying to run code for things like the text prompt generator on pages that I did not intend for it to be running on. It 
            took me forever to figure out how to fix it. I finally just made JavaScript files for the specific functions running on each page and only 
            attached that file to the right page... I also did intend to try to do the setting of an image as the background on the home page, but the 
            styling kept getting all messed up since I had a repeating linear gradient on the other pages and I could not figure out how to adjust my 
            original style sheet to allow me to do what I wanted with it. My final major concern is all the forms I created for this website. When I 
            started coding, I thought we would get to the chapter that discusses getting the form data and dealing with it, but we aren't covering it this 
            semester. I'll either have to try to figure it out on my own or just leave the forms where people can submit things, but I don't know how to 
            retrieve the data... One thing I really don't want to do is delete all that coding I did for those forms, that took FOREVER, even when I 
            heavily used copy&paste! I suppose it is a bit ironic that this website is so focused on AI image generators and how much I am using them 
            since for my current English I submitted a research paper arguing that using things like image generators, video generators, and text 
            generators to write papers or novels is limiting humankind's creativity. I really do believe that, but my own drawing skills are really 
            terrible, so I would never be able to produce anything like the kind of images I can generate with AI. One of the things I am most worried 
            about is the use of AI in writing essays for homework, writing for work, and writing novels/poems, etc. Too many young people are using AI 
            generators for those purposes and I feel they are losing the skills needed to problem solve creatively by doing so. I admit this is getting 
            kind of rambling, but to fill up this page with some text I am pretty much just freewriting now.</p>
